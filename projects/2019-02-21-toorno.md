Although I work as a freelance developer, another huge passion of mine is Coffee. This is why I've been a professional Barista for quite some time and by working in coffee shops I've realized how poorly they were organizing the schedule.

This is when I decided to build Toorno. Toorno is a staff management software built with Nuxt that helps restaurant owners organize their staff in a faster and smarter way.
