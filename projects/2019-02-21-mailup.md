MailUp is an fast-growing email marketing company from Italy. After I've built the e-learning platform together with the guys @ Lacerba, they approached us and asked to build something similar for them in order to train their customers.

The plan we have for this project, however, is much bigger than that. The platform has been built using a SaaS model that will allow us to easily plug in new customers as they come.

The backend has been built with Ruby on Rails, while the frontend is Nuxt server-side rendered SPA.
