LOVEThESIGN is the leading Italian online boutique for the best in home design. Itâ€™s a very fast-growing startup founded in Milan. To support the growth, they needed to switch from the Joomla platform they used to be based on to something more scalable and customizable.

Together with their team we've created two platforms. The e-commerce using Syllius and the Magazine (blog) using Laravel. No fancy frontend framework used.
